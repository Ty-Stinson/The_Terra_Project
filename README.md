# The Terra Project
Hello Everyone,
  This project serves as my first independent foray into Machine Learning. Using the Composite KOI data set from the Exoplanet archive, the objective of the program is to predict whether planetary systems will be confirmed as a planetary system or marked as a false positive using a machine learning algorithm.  This project is a work in progress so expect updates soon.
